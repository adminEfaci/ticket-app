# Ticket Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Ticket Management System implementation, verifying that all features are complete and properly integrated.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. File Upload and Pairing System ✅
**Location**: `/upload` endpoint and page

- **XLS+PDF Pairing Logic**:
  - Files are automatically paired by matching filenames (e.g., `APRIL_14_2025.xls` + `APRIL_14_2025.pdf`)
  - 90% similarity threshold for filename matching
  - Supports multiple file pairs in single upload session
  - Visual pairing indicator in frontend

- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Only XLS file: Marked as incomplete pair, can be completed later
  - Only PDF file: Marked as incomplete pair, can be completed later
  - Mismatched files: Clear error reporting
  - Duplicate filenames: Prevented by file hash validation

### 2. Batch Processing System ✅
**Location**: `/batch` endpoints and `/batches` page

- **Features**:
  - Batch creation with multiple file pairs
  - Status tracking (pending → processing → completed/failed)
  - Client assignment (optional)
  - Batch statistics and processing results
  - Error handling and retry capability

### 3. Ticket Extraction from XLS ✅
**Backend**: `backend/services/xls_parser_service.py`

- **Extraction Process**:
  - Parses XLS files to extract REPRINT tickets
  - Filters out REPRINT VOID tickets
  - Extracts all required fields (ticket number, dates, weights, references, etc.)
  - Maps to database schema with proper validation

### 4. PDF Image Extraction ✅
**Backend**: `backend/services/pdf_extraction_service.py`

- **Features**:
  - Extracts ticket images from multi-page PDFs
  - OCR processing for ticket number detection
  - Automatic image cropping and enhancement
  - Storage in organized directory structure

### 5. Ticket-Image Matching ✅
**Backend**: `backend/services/ticket_image_matcher.py`

- **Matching Logic**:
  - Fuzzy matching with configurable threshold
  - OCR-based ticket number extraction
  - Manual review queue for uncertain matches
  - Match confidence scoring

### 6. Client Management ✅
**Frontend**: `/admin/clients` page
**Backend**: `/api/clients` endpoints

- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for clients
  - CSV import/export
  - Hierarchical client relationships
  - Rate management per client
  - Reference number mapping

### 7. Weekly Export System ✅
**Backend**: `backend/services/weekly_export_service.py` & `export_bundle_service.py`
**Frontend**: `/export` page

- **Export Structure**:
```
export_YYYYMMDD.zip
├── merged.csv                    # All tickets in one file
├── week_2025-04-14/             # Monday-Saturday grouping
│   ├── manifest.csv             # Week summary
│   └── client_ClientName/       # Per-client folder
│       ├── invoice.csv          # Client invoice
│       └── tickets/             # Ticket images
│           └── REF_001/         # Per-reference folders
│               ├── 12345.png    # Ticket images
│               └── 12346.png
└── audit.json                   # Export metadata and validation
```

- **Features**:
  - Automatic Monday-Saturday week detection
  - Client-based folder organization
  - Reference number sub-grouping
  - Financial calculations with 2-decimal precision
  - Validation and error reporting
  - Force export option for partial data

### 8. Authentication & Authorization ✅
**Backend**: JWT-based authentication
**Frontend**: Protected routes with role-based access

- **User Roles**:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - Manager: Export and reporting access
  - User: Upload and view own data
  - Viewer: Read-only access

### 9. Frontend Implementation ✅

#### Pages Implemented:
1. **Dashboard** (`/`): Overview and quick stats
2. **Upload** (`/upload`): Drag-and-drop file pairing interface
3. **Batches** (`/batches`): Batch management and processing
4. **Clients** (`/clients`): Client listing and stats
5. **Export** (`/export`): Weekly export generation
6. **Settings** (`/settings`): User and system settings
7. **Admin Panel** (`/admin/*`):
   - User management
   - Client management
   - Rate configuration
   - Terminal access

#### UI Features:
- Modern, animated interface with Framer Motion
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time status updates
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Visual file pairing
- Progress indicators
- Toast notifications

## Sample Files Support ✅

The system fully supports the provided sample files:
- `APRIL_14_2025.xls` + `APRIL_14_2025.pdf`
- `APRIL_15_2025.xls` + `APRIL_15_2025.pdf`

These files are automatically:
1. Paired by matching filenames
2. Processed to extract REPRINT tickets
3. Grouped into week 2025-04-14 (Monday-Saturday)
4. Organized by client and reference in exports

## Business Logic Implementation ✅

### Ticket Processing Rules:
1. **REPRINT Status**: Only tickets marked as REPRINT are included
2. **VOID Exclusion**: REPRINT VOID tickets are excluded from exports
3. **Billable Flag**: Only billable tickets are included in financial calculations
4. **Weight Validation**: Tickets must have positive net weight

### Export Validation:
1. **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate ticket numbers
2. **Client Assignment**: Ensures all tickets have assigned clients
3. **Rate Availability**: Verifies rates exist for ticket dates
4. **Image Matching**: Reports match percentage (not required)

### Financial Calculations:
- All monetary values use 2-decimal precision
- Rates are per tonne (1000 kg)
- Subtotals calculated per reference
- Totals calculated per client and week

## Testing & Verification

### Test Script Provided:
`test_weekly_export_system.py` - Comprehensive test covering:
- File upload and pairing
